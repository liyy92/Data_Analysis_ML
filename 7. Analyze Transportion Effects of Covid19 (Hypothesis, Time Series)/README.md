## Introduction  

From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people. So according to some daily level information data sets. The outbreak of Covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis, and it's starting to influence important aspects of daily life. For example:

•	Transportation: Companies around the globe have rolled out mandatory remote work. Bans have been placed on hotspot countries, corporate travel has been reduced, and flight fares have dropped.

•	Grocery stores: In highly affected areas, people are starting to stock up on essential goods.
